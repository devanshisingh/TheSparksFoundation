Data Science and Business Analytics Internship

Task 1 - linreg.R - Prediction Using Supervised ML
Builds a simple linear regression model of 2 variables based on the data (http://bit.ly/w-data). 
Predicts the value of Score at the specified value of Hours, i.e. 9.25.

Task 2 - kmeans.R - Prediction using Unsupervised Learning
From the ‘Iris’ dataset, predicts the optimum number of clusters using the Elbow Method and represents it visually.

Task 3 - dt.R - Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm
Built a model on the Iris dataset that builds a decision tree using the training data. The model can accept new data and also classify it accordingly. The accuracy of this model is 95%.
